# Tech Stack

**Any code changes or intereactions with Gitlab must account for our stack and set-up**

- **React and TypeScript:** We use version 18 of React with Typescript.
- **API:** Apollo Client for GraphQL
- **Version control:** Our front-end repo is in Gitlab and is called 'Falbala'. We merge to a `develop` branch, not main or master. **Do NOT attempt to checkout or push to a main or master branch.**
- **Unit Tests:** Jest and React Testing Library.
- **Front-end component tests:** Cypress.
- **Jira:** All tickets are in the format MAV-##### where the hashes are numbers.
- **UI Component Library:** a custom wrapper around MUI called 'Smoothie'. **For new components, we always import from Smoothie.**

- **Any doubts about stack and version numbers?:** Check our package.json for a list of the libraries/packages we use and their version numbers.

**REMEMBER: Our main branch is called `develop`.**
