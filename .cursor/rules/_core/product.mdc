Dialectica is a global information services firm that connects clients with vetted subject‑matter experts to support confident, time‑critical decisions. 
Expert networks source, screen and schedule one‑to‑one consultations, and deliver targeted, real‑time insights beyond public research.

The Maven CRM: 
- manages clients, client users, companies and projects;
- orchestrates expert recruitment and matching through Expert Finder; and
- supports end‑to‑end, compliant delivery of expert consultations and insights.

The frontend is a React/Apollo GraphQL application that uses our Smoothie design system (our wrapper over MUI). It targets a consistent, accessible user experience.
