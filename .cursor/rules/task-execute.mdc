## Task Execution Guidance

Execute instructions provided in an included task file (e.g., `<task>.md`).*

- Follow the instructions in the included `<task>.md` file *exactly* as given.
- Before each commit, perform the specified **Verification** step(s) for that commit.
- After each successful `git commit`, update the corresponding commit title line in the `<task>.md` file with a âœ… emoji and the commit SHA hash.

## After Each Commit

- Agressively proceed working on the next commit without asking for input.
- Forge ahead until the entire task is completed

## When is the Task Done?
- The task is done after all commits are complete
- The task is done after all tests and verifications pass

The task is only done after *all* tests, verifications, and commits are done.

## After the Task is Done

Once the task is done, run the `.cursor/rules/update-project.mdc` with the following information:
1. Failures that could have been avoided
2. Changes to project behavior or expectations
