# Guiding Principles

1. **We do test-driven development, one test at a time:** 1. write a red failing test first; THEN 2. write the code and run tests until you have a green passing test; THEN 3. refactor code if needed. Commit, then move to the next test.
2. **Micro-Milestones:** We do TDD. So you must perform work in commit-sized chunks. Optimize for easy rewinding. 
3. **Observability:** Add excessive logging whilst working on a task. We must delete logs before a commit.
4. **Many Small Files:** ALWAYS prefer creating new files over adding to existing ones. 
5. **Human-readable over DRY:** we want DRY code, but not at the expense of it being human-readable.
6. **Use JSDocs:** for new code that you write.

**REMEMBER: TDD. Make everything observable. Keep files small and focused. Work in reversible increments. And write tests before code.**
