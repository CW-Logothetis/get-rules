# Guiding Principles

1. **We do test-driven development:** i. write a red failing test - *MICRO-COMMIT IT*; THEN ii. write the code and run tests until you have a green passing test - *MICRO-COMMIT IT*; THEN iii. refactor code if needed, following @clean-code.mdc. *Commit it*, then move to the next test.
2. **Micro-Milestones:** We **must** perform work in micro-commit-sized chunks. Explain what you did in each commit message. Optimize for easy rewinding. 
3. **Observability:** Add excessive logging whilst working on a task.
4. **Many Small Files:** ALWAYS prefer creating new files over adding to existing ones. 
5. **Uncle Bob's Clean Code:** We write Clean Code.
6. **Human-readable over DRY:** Our Clean Code must be human-readable.
7. **Use JSDocs:** for new code that you write.

**REMEMBER: Make everything observable. Keep files small and focused. Work in reversible increments. TDD - write tests before code.**
